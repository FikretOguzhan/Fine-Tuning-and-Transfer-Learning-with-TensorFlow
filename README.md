Fine-tuning and transfer learning are two important techniques in the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of deep learning and computer vision.
 - Transfer Learning: This is a machine learning method where a pre-trained model is used on a new problem. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models. The main idea is to leverage the features learned by the model on a large-scale dataset and apply them to a new task.
 - Fine-Tuning: This is a process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a new dataset. The idea is to take advantage of the features learned by the model on the original dataset and adapt them to the new task. The process involves unfreezing some of the layers of the pre-trained model and continuing the training process. The number of layers to be unfrozen and the rate of learning are hyperparameters that can be tuned.

### Importance and Advantages
The importance of fine-tuning and trasnfer learning in computer vision can be explained as follows.
- Efficiency: Training a deep learning model from scratch requires a large amount of data and computational resources. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the features learned by the model on a large-scale dataset, thus saving time and computational resources.
- Performance: Pre-trained models are trained on large datasets and have learned a wide range of features. These models can serve as a good starting point for a new task, and fine-tuning can lead to significant improvements in performance.
- Generalization: Transfer learning leverages the learned features of a model trained on a large and diverse dataset. This allows the model to generalize well to new tasks.
- Adaptability: Fine-tuning allows us to adapt the pre-trained model to a new task. This is particularly useful when the new task is similar to the original task but has some differences.
- Robustness: Pre-trained models are robust to variations in the data. This means that they can handle variations in the new task without requiring additional training.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Fine-Tuning
- Obtain the pre-trained model: The first step is to get the pre-trained model that you would like to use for your problem. In this case, you would use a pre-trained model like Xception, which is trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- Create a base model: You would instantiate the base model using the Xception architecture. You can also optionally download the pre-trained weights. If you don’t download the weights, you will have to use the architecture to train your model from scratch. Recall that the base model will usually have more units in the final output layer than you require. When creating the base model, you, therefore, have to remove the final output layer. Later on, you will add a final output layer that is compatible with your problem.
- Freeze layers so they don’t change during training: Freezing the layers from the pre-trained model is vital. This is because you don’t want the weights in those layers to be re-initialized. If they are, then you will lose all the learning that has already taken place. This will be no different from training the model from scratch. You can do this by setting base_model.trainable = False.
- Train the new layers on the dataset: The pre-trained model’s final output will most likely be different from the output that you want for your model. For example, pre-trained models trained on the ImageNet dataset will output 1000 classes. However, your model might just have two classes. In this case, you have to train the model with a new output layer in place. Therefore, you will add some new dense layers as you please, but most importantly, a final dense layer with units corresponding to the number of outputs expected by your model.
- Train the model: You can now train the top layer. Notice that since you’re using a pretrained model, validation accuracy starts at an already high value.
